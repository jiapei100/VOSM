--------------------------- Release 0.3.1 --November, 2010--------------------
Right after VOSM 0.3.0 was released on November 8, 2010,
due to prompt feedbacks from some VOSM users,

     The only 3rd party libraries that VOSM 0.3.1 is based upon are
     
      a) Boost (>= 1.34.1) for file and directory operations
      b) OpenCV (subervsion R3594 or above) as the basic but primary libraries 
         that VOSM 0.3.1 is built upon

   - A formal documentation is produced for reference

   - Add brief descriptions for every class


----------------------------- Release 0.3 --November, 2010--------------------

It has been a long time for Vision Open to release its recent 
research fruits related to ASM/AAMs.
VOSM 0.3 offers a thoroughly fresh coding implementations, 
and lots of improvements and new functionalities : 

1 General

  - Current VOSM can only be legally used under LGPL, namely,
	Lesser General Public License.

  - Current VOSM libraries requires CMake for configuration.

  - Changes in the set of supported platforms:

    - Fully supported by GNU g++ 4.5 and tested.

    - Well supported by Microsoft Windows Visual Studio 
	  C++ compiler 2008 (VC9). You may have to re-configure accordingly.

  - Changes in the set of supported OpenCV:

    - Must be OpenCV SVN R3594 or above 
	  (OpenCV 2.1 is too old to be compile with current VOSM 0.3)

2 Algorithms

  - Current VOSM affords 2D Profile ASM, which is dramatically faster
    than traditional 1D Profile ASM.

  - Current VOSM proposes a conceptual novel idea named as
    Active Feature Model.

  - Current VOSM implements all popular ASMs/AAMs,
    both for static images and dynamic videos, including:

	- 1D profile ASM

    - 2D profile ASM

    - Direct Local texture contrained (LTC) ASM

    - Basic AAM

    - ICIA(Inverse compositional image alignment) AAM

    - IAIA(Inverse additive image alignment) AAM

----------------------------- Release 0.2 -- April, 2008----------------------

Second release of "AAMBuilding":

    - No source, but a xwWidget based GUI application 
	  with some binary static libraries for model building.

----------------------------- Release 0.1 -- February, 2007-------------------

Initial release of "AAMBuilding", 

  	- Contains only the model building code.
