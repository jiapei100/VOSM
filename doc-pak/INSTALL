INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


INTRODUCTION
============

This file describes how to install VOSM. The instructions in this file
are for the most common use cases, and cover the command line tools. 

The documentation of VOSM is available in HTML formats.
It is not bundled with the software but can be viewed separately at
<http://visionopen.com/cv/vosm/doc/html/>.

For more information about VOSM, refer to the <http://www.visionopen.com/cv/sm.php>.


PREREQUISITES
=============

To install VOSM, you need 'cmake' and several third-party libraries are pre-requisite. 

   * CMake (>= 2.6.2), the build system used by VOSM
     Required for building VOSM

   * OpenCV (>= 2.2.0)

   * Boost (>= 1.34.1)
     Required for building VOSM and for applications using VOSM
     Required compiled Boost library: Boost.Regex
     Optional compiled Boost library: Boost.Filesystem
     http://www.boost.org/

CONFIGURATION
=============

To configure VOSM, type

  cmake .

in the directory that contains this INSTALL file. You can add several options
to this command. The most important ones are

  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir>          installation directory [/usr/local]
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release>    build type [Release]
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=<TRUE|FALSE>      shared or static libraries [TRUE]
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<program>          C compiler [gcc]
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<program>        C++ compiler [g++]

In case you want to add additional compiler and linker flags, you can use

  -DCGAL_CXX_FLAGS                      additional compiler flags
  -DCGAL_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS            add. linker flags (static libraries)
  -DCGAL_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS            add. linker flags (shared libraries)
  -DCGAL_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS               add. linker flags (executables)

Variants with the additional suffix "_DEBUG" and "_RELEASE" allow to set
separate values for debug and release builds. In case you do not want to add
additional flags, but to override the default flags, replace "VOSM" by
"CMAKE" in the variable names above.

Note that CMake maintains a cache name "CMakeCache.txt". If you change options
(or your environment changes), it is best to remove that file to avoid
problems.


BUILDING
========

To build the VOSM libraries, type

  make                               (or nmake in a Windows command prompt)

If you want, you can install the VOSM header and libraries. To do so, type

  make install

A list of all available make targets can be obtained by

  make help


OUT-OF-SOURCE BUILDS
====================

The above instructions build the VOSM library in the same directory tree as
the VOSM sources. Sometimes it is advisable to place all the generated files
somewhere else. For example, if you want to build the library in several
configurations (debug and release, different compilers, and so on). Using
different build directories keeps all the generated files separated for each
configuration.

In the following, $VOSM_SRC denotes the directory with the VOSM sources;
$VOSM_BUILD is an arbitrary directory where the generated files will be
placed. You can perform an out-of-source build as follows:

  mkdir $VOSM_BUILD
  cd $VOSM_BUILD
  cmake [options] $VOSM_SRC
  make
  make install                       (if desired)

Basically, the only difference is the last parameter of the "cmake" command:
$VOSM_SRC instead of "." .
