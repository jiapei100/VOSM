# VOSM

## What does VOSM stand for?

Vision Open Statistical Model ([VOSM](https://github.com/jiapei100/VOSM)) contains variants of 2D Statistical Models, namely, variants of [ASMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shape_model) and [AAMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_appearance_model). It's mainly composed of two parts:

* **Building**: build the statistical models (**both 2D and 3D** are supported in [VOSM](https://github.com/jiapei100/VOSM)). For now, the following models can be built by specifying different parameters:
  - Shape Model: ```-t "SM"```, fundamental shape model
  - Texture Model: ```-t "TM"```, fundamental texture model
  - [Appearance Model](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/main/node15.html): ```-t "AM"```, fundamental appearance model, originated from [Basic AAM](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/main/node16.html)
  - Image Alignment appearance Model: ```-t "IA"```, inverse compositional image alignment, for [ICIA AAM](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub4/matthews_iain_2004_2/matthews_iain_2004_2.pdf)
  - Feature Model: ```-t "FM"```, a generalized model based on **ANY** type of features adopted by the users
  - Shape model with Local Texture Constraints: ```-t "SMLTC"```, originated from [CLM](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/timothy.f.cootes/Models/clm.html)
  - SMNDPROFILE. ```-t "SMNDPROFILE"```, including original [1D profile ASM](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/downloads/asmprops/node3.html) and [2D profile ASM](http://www.visionopen.com/members/jiapei/publications/pei_thesischapter34.pdf) proposed by me, please check [chapter 3 of my PhD thesis](http://www.visionopen.com/members/jiapei/publications/pei_thesischapter34.pdf).

* **Fitting**: test the effects of fitting (**ONLY 2D fitting** is suppprted in [VOSM](https://github.com/jiapei100/VOSM))

## How to use VOSM?
Please refer to our wiki [How to use VOSM?](https://github.com/jiapei100/VOSM/wiki/How-to-use-VOSM%3F).


## Cascade Files for Face Components
In file [testsmfitting](https://github.com/jiapei100/VOSM/blob/master/samples/testsmfitting/testsmfitting.cpp), 4 cascade files are used to detect 4 different face parts:

* left eye: [haarcascade_mcs_lefteye_alt.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/modules/face/data/cascades/haarcascade_mcs_lefteye_alt.xml)
* right eye: [haarcascade_mcs_righteye_alt.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/modules/face/data/cascades/haarcascade_mcs_righteye_alt.xml)
* nose: [haarcascade_mcs_nose.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/modules/face/data/cascades/haarcascade_mcs_nose.xml)
* mouth: [haarcascade_mcs_mouth.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/modules/face/data/cascades/haarcascade_mcs_mouth.xml)

which can be found in [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/face/data/cascades).
